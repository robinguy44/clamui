# ClamUI Log Manager Module
"""
Log manager module for ClamUI providing log persistence and retrieval.
Stores scan/update operation logs and provides daemon log access.

Security: Input Sanitization for Log Injection Prevention
==========================================================

This module implements comprehensive input sanitization to prevent log injection
attacks and log obfuscation when storing file paths, threat names, and ClamAV
output in log entries.

Attack Vectors Mitigated
------------------------

1. **Control Characters**
   Threat: Malicious filenames containing control characters (e.g., \\x07 bell,
   \\x08 backspace, \\x0C form feed) could manipulate terminal output or confuse
   log viewing tools.
   Mitigation: All control characters except safe whitespace (space, tab) are
   removed from single-line fields. Multi-line fields preserve newlines/tabs but
   remove other control characters.

2. **ANSI Escape Sequences**
   Threat: ANSI escape codes (e.g., \\x1b[31m for red text, \\x1b[2J to clear
   screen) embedded in filenames could hide malicious content, modify displayed
   text, or obscure log entries when viewed in terminals.
   Mitigation: All ANSI escape sequences are detected and removed using a
   comprehensive regex pattern that matches CSI sequences (\\x1b[...m) and other
   escape codes.

3. **Unicode Bidirectional Overrides**
   Threat: Unicode bidirectional control characters (U+202A-U+202E, U+2066-U+2069)
   can reverse or modify the displayed order of text, allowing attackers to craft
   filenames that appear benign but actually reference malicious files. Example:
   "file\\u202Etxt.exe" displays as "fileexe.txt" but is actually an executable.
   Mitigation: All Unicode bidirectional override characters are removed from all
   log fields.

4. **Log Injection via Newlines**
   Threat: Crafted filenames containing newline characters (\\n or \\r) could
   inject fake log entries or split a single log entry across multiple lines,
   potentially forging scan results or hiding malicious activity. Example:
   "clean.txt\\nINFECTED: virus.exe\\nClean scan" could appear as three separate
   log lines.
   Mitigation: Newlines are converted to spaces in single-line fields (summary,
   path, threat names) to prevent entry injection. Multi-line fields (details,
   stdout) preserve legitimate newlines from ClamAV output.

5. **Null Byte Injection**
   Threat: Null bytes (\\x00) can truncate strings in some contexts or confuse
   parsers, potentially hiding parts of filenames or log content.
   Mitigation: All null bytes are removed from all fields before storage.

Sanitization Implementation
---------------------------

The module uses two sanitization functions from src/core/sanitize.py:

- **sanitize_log_line()**: For single-line fields (summary, path, threat names)
  Removes: control chars, ANSI escapes, Unicode bidi, null bytes, newlines
  Preserves: printable text, spaces, tabs

- **sanitize_log_text()**: For multi-line fields (details, stdout)
  Removes: control chars (except newlines/tabs), ANSI escapes, Unicode bidi, null bytes
  Preserves: printable text, spaces, tabs, newlines, carriage returns

Entry Points Sanitized
-----------------------

All LogEntry creation methods apply sanitization:

1. **LogEntry.create()** - Direct entry creation
   - Sanitizes: summary (line), details (text), path (line)

2. **LogEntry.from_scan_result_data()** - Scanner integration
   - Sanitizes: path, threat_details (file_path, threat_name), error_message,
     stdout, suffix
   - Used by: Scanner, DaemonScanner

3. **LogEntry.from_dict()** - JSON deserialization
   - Sanitizes: type, status, summary, details, path
   - Protection: Defense against tampering with stored log files

Defense in Depth
----------------

Sanitization is applied at multiple layers:

1. **Input Layer**: All user-controlled input from scan results is sanitized
   before building log entry fields (from_scan_result_data).

2. **Creation Layer**: All fields are sanitized again when creating LogEntry
   instances (create method).

3. **Deserialization Layer**: Fields are sanitized when reading from disk to
   protect against maliciously crafted or tampered log files (from_dict).

This multi-layer approach ensures that even if log files are manually edited or
replaced by an attacker, the malicious content cannot affect log viewers or
exploit downstream systems.

Example Attack Scenarios Prevented
-----------------------------------

1. **ANSI Obfuscation**:
   Malicious file: "/tmp/\\x1b[2Kharmless.txt\\x1b[31m[INFECTED]\\x1b[0m"
   Without sanitization: Clears line and shows fake infection marker in red
   With sanitization: "/tmp/harmless.txt[INFECTED]" (escape codes removed)

2. **Log Injection**:
   Malicious file: "safe.txt\\n[2024-01-15] INFECTED: virus.exe\\nClean scan"
   Without sanitization: Appears as three log entries, forging an infection
   With sanitization: "safe.txt [2024-01-15] INFECTED: virus.exe Clean scan"

3. **Unicode Direction Spoofing**:
   Malicious file: "document\\u202Efdp.exe" (displays as "documentexe.pdf")
   Without sanitization: Appears to be a PDF but is actually an executable
   With sanitization: "documentfdp.exe" (true extension visible)

Security Testing
----------------

The sanitization implementation has comprehensive test coverage:

- tests/core/test_sanitize.py: 80+ unit tests for sanitization functions
- tests/core/test_log_manager.py: Integration tests for LogEntry sanitization
- Coverage includes: control chars, ANSI escapes, Unicode bidi, null bytes,
  newlines, edge cases, real-world attack scenarios, ClamAV output formats
