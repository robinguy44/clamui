# ClamUI Application
"""
Main Adwaita Application class for ClamUI.

This module defines the ClamUIApp class, which is the central GTK4/Adwaita
application that manages the complete lifecycle of the ClamUI antivirus GUI.

Key Responsibilities:
    - Application lifecycle management (startup, activation, shutdown)
    - View management and navigation between different UI panels
    - System tray integration via TrayManager subprocess
    - Profile management integration for scan configurations
    - Settings and notification management coordination
    - GTK action setup for keyboard shortcuts and menu actions

The application uses GLib.idle_add for thread-safe UI updates when handling
callbacks from the tray indicator subprocess, ensuring all GTK operations
occur on the main thread.

Classes:
    ClamUIApp: Main Adw.Application subclass managing the application.

Example:
    from clamui.app import ClamUIApp

    app = ClamUIApp()
    exit_code = app.run(sys.argv)
